# ideal-food-machine
Beginner Project on Food101_tiny dataset. Implementation of CNN. 
The first couple of codes are on the food-101 tiny data set consisting of 1500 images and 500 images on training and validation respectively. However, the last collab code is implemented on the larger data set of 101,000 images. It gives a higher accuracy of about 79% on validation data compared to a mere 39% of previous codes. It is highly suggested to run the collab code on Google collab after having activated GPU.
